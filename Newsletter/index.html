            <h2>Mbah's Newsletter</h2>

            <p>Welcome to my Newsletter. Here, i believe i am sharing my thoughts with people  seeking to grow in their
            programming life.
            </p>

            <p>So, I built a project. It was built out of a need to send cold emails to recruiters 
            and in a fast way because let's face it
            sending different emails to different people can be a ton of work so automating it seemed to be a great idea.
            </p>

            <p>The code in this project could also work to send emails 
            to a bunch of people subscribed to a newsletter with a few tweaks. I'm certain. 
            Plus it also helped me practise my python and improved my skill of researching. 
            Attached below is the code snippet.
